As you move through your urban environments, you will find that 7 unique elements are detectable in certain places.  These elements contain special properties related to the urban zones they are found in, and it is up to you to determine which are which.  After accumulating a number of these elements, you will notice that there are certain properties that attract one to another, thereby creating an alloy of the two.  This complex array of alloys displays the combinatory qualities of the elements that they are comprised of, culminating into an alien landform.  Landform alloys will range from solid ground to liquids to atmospheric events to as yet unknown conditions of the Patternist-3 landscape.
