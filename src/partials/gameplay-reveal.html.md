Alloys form the tectonic qualities of the Patternist planet, its formations hovering above our own. Choosing from the 21 alloys, players can apply them to reveal a detailed alien landscape that will increase in complexity as they go. Patternist gameplay culminates in the revelation of these Patternist-3 planet landscapes.

With this combinatory system of landform generation, the possible alloys offer players a spatial riddle of geologic systems, allowing players to experiment with new topologies, while ambiently rehearsing alternatives to the real world we know. 

The game becomes a method to blend realities, weaving them together in ways that allow players to navigate both worlds simultaneously.
