The in-game trading system is based on <a href="https://unenumerated.blogspot.de/2007/06/nanobarter.html" trade="_blank">algorithmic matching</a> and balancing protocols that remember players' preferences to search for likely trades, so long as the players are within proximity of one another, either geographically or in the game environment.

The system is managed by a network trade algorithm. In short, this means the game will take into account what all players are offering and try to facilitate a multi-directional trade between a network of players &#8212; from one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many.

With the in-game elements acting as demurrage currency, the game virtually rehearses a localized resource barter system, with a focus on the urban.
