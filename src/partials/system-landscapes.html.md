The difficulties of mapping an exoplanet 40 light years away might seems more daunting than they are.  You will be taking advantage of the most advanced landscape sensing satellite hardware and software that has yet to be seen.  The mapping technologies that we currently have at our disposal and ready for your use are optical photogrammetry, multi-spectral analysis, hyper-spectral imaging, optical synthetic aperture radar, laser scanning and tunable diode laser spectroscopy, and process gas chromatography.  

On Patternist, the only rules we know to follow are the broadest that physics can describe.  After that, any combination of materials, climates, magnetisms, and the alien manifestations of their interactions will determine a landscape that is just beyond our reach.  What new worlds are possible?  What forms can you envision?
