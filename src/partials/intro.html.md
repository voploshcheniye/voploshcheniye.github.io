Patternist is a location-based, augmented reality exploration game that allows you to reveal new aspects of your own city. You will detect uncharted elements among the familiar ones, and reveal alien landscapes that can veil and eventually envelope the conventional. Unusual maps, trades, and encoded perspectives lay in wait for you as you engage with urban environments through the lens of a newly identified exoplanet. You may even stumble upon the source of a mysterious phenomenon in the process.
