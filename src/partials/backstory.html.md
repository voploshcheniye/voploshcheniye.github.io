In the early years of the 21st century, a myriad number of attempts were being made to document in detail the newly discovered exoplanets in our corner of the universe.  Chief among them was the dense and potentially fertile Trappist system.  Through the efforts of a few private corporations, a wide net of nano-satellites were launched towards the system aboard laser-directed light sails.  What they would discover upon arrival was anyone’s guess.

By the time 80% of the humankind’s earthbound populations had migrated to urban areas, the satellites would arrive in the system and begin to transmit their findings.  At this point, a vast array of terrestrial and extraterrestrial sensor imaging equipment had been deployed to capture and codify the massive amounts of data that were coming into view.  

As the transmissions began, their existence and their protocols were leaked.  The paranoia surrounding the existing earth observation missions extended to the Trappist Observations Mission. That's when The Events began.  

At first we thought it was the weather…
