Alloys form the tectonic qualities of the Patternist planet, its formations hovering above our own. Choosing from the 21 alloys, players can apply them to reveal a detailed alien landscape that will increase in complexity as they go.

With this combinatory system of landform generation, the possible alloys offer players a spatial riddle of geologic systems, allowing players to experiment with new topologies.
