What observations will Patternist inherit from Moscow City, where the tallest commercial towers in Europe sit in a sea of parking and security gates? Or 100 meters away, in a uniform residential neighbourhood, of iconic soviet Kruschevki, slated for imminent demolition? Or just at the post-industrial adaptive factory district of Bolotniyy Ostrov, at the bridge beside Strelka Institute?

Walking from neighborhood to neighborhood, gamers will be able to see scales of complexity in map pieces that can be played upon, each one a unique transcription of an augmentation on that area. The game becomes a method to blend realities, weaving them together in ways that allow players to navigate both worlds simultaneously.
