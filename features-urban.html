In Patternist, gameplay is built around urban typologies and dynamics that privilege experiences of the city residents, which often fall outside the dominant approaches to spatial analysis and development. 

Each type of in-game element spawns in a different urban layer &#8212; from underpasses to security points, the elements you can collect depend on where you are in the city. As players reveal augmented reality landforms by using these elements, the alien landforms become symbolic, visual representations of the urban spaces where players originally collected elements.

Through urban augmented reality, Patternist proposes a shifting alter-landscape, transposing and transmutating everyday city passageways, prime for an alternative entry point into research on urban systems and flows.
