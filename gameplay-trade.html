In the multiplayer environment, you can trade elements with other players, but only when they are nearby. Trading is necessary for players to collect elements which may not exist in their everyday environment.

The trade menus operate based on the proximity of other players, populating your marketplace with different offers that are nearby.  You can choose elements and quantities, as well as schedule trades for later.
